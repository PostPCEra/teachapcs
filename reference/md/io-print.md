#Printing

When programming, it is usefull to print information to the terminal screen/console output window. For example, if you have a program that takes an integer dollarAmount as input, and it returns the amount with sales tax / meals tax, the program would print out the final amount to the screen. Here is a basic example of printing to the screen: 
  
  System.out.println("Hello World!"); //prints Hello World!

The System part of the statement accesses all of the methods/classes associated with the System class. The out part of the statement is accessing all of the methods/classes related to output. println is a method contained in System.out. It is abbreviated and stands for Print Line, or print the following information and then a new line. It prints a new line by outputing a \n, or newline character, which does the equivalent of pressing enter on your keyboard. You can use the System.out.print method if you do not want to print a newline character by default.
